# matlab-pretty-figures
Make pretty figures in [MATLAB] to publish in LaTeX.

### Requires
1. [export_fig]
2. [matlab2tikz]

#### Why use this
Ever thought that the figures in your LaTeX publication could be a little bit prettier, and that you don't have to add the same lines over and over every time in your figure to make it look the way you want? Fear not, matlab-pretty-figures would solve your problem.

I will use two libraries, [export_fig] to export your figure to an EPS or PDF files and [matlab2tikz] to covert them into a Tikz plot that can be directly included in your LaTeX file. Download them from the links, and make sure to add the files to MATLAB's search path.
